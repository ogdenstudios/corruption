It was called Settlement until a man in the park said, it looks interesting but sounds like a game about real estate.  Then it was called Corrupt.  Now I'm not sure.  But here goes:

The board is 7 x 7 and alternates light and dark tiles.  Like a chessboard they are notated A1 - H7.  Unlike a chessboard there is a dedicated center, D4.  The rows are ranks, and the columns are files.

There are four piece types.  The quantity each player begins the game with is notated in ( )

	1) Sovereign (1)
	2) Diplomat (1)
	3) Consultant (2)
	4) Contractor (3)

There are also a collection of towers.  35 of them can be used to construct the first or second level of a three level tower.  Another 14 can be used only to construct the third level of a tower. 

Each player begins the game by constructing a three towers, a three level, a two level, and a single level.  Place the Diplomat on the second level, and the Sovereign on the third level.  Leave everything off the board for now.  The winner of Rock Paper Scissors, or some other contest of your choosing if desired, goes first.  

Begin the game by taking turns placing pieces.  All pieces must be placed in each player's back two ranks (1-2 or 6-7), except for the one level tower which may be placed on your third rank (3 or 5).  For the sake of notation, the player who goes first begins play on ranks 1-2, whereas the second player begins on ranks 6-7. 

Start with the Sovereign atop the three level tower, followed by the Diplomat atop the two level tower.  Then take turns placing each Consultant, followed by the three Contractors.  When the third contractor is placed, build the remaining one level tower in any adjacent space, including diagonally.

The objective of the game is to maneuver the Sovereign across the board to the opponent's back two ranks and climb atop a three level tower.  Before getting to piece movement it is important to understand the towers and to visualize key components of movement.  On the ground level pieces move horizontally, then vertically.  In order to ascend to the first level of a tower, the piece moves horizontally onto the space, then up vertically one level.  If the tower is connected orthogonally to other towers the piece can move throughout the connected towers before ascending vertically.  If a piece is placed on a tower it descends the tower to the ground level, before carrying out its movement rules.

There are exceptions to these rules, which are hopefully cleared up with the piece movement rules, listed below.  A turn consists of moving one of the four pieces and carrying out its action.

Contractors can move one space in any direction, including diagonally, then ascend up to one level, including diagonally––even if there is no tower orthogonally adjacent (other pieces cannot move diagonally).  After moving, you must build a tower on an adjacent space, including diagonally.  The tower can be any level, regardless of the level of the contractor.  If there are no towers available to build, contractors cannot be moved.

Consultants move similarly to the knight in chess––two spaces in one direction, one space perpendicular, then ascend up to two levels.  Consultants cannot move throughout towers like the other pieces can.  After moving, if applicable, remove the top level of the tower on the space the Consultant was moved to.  If an opponents piece occupies the space, remove it from play for the remainder of the game.  Return the tower to the communal pool of towers.

The Sovereign can move any number of unoccupied spaces in any direction, excluding diagonally, then may ascend up to one level.  The Sovereign is the most important piece on the board.  If your opponent is threatening to capture the Sovereign you must move it.  If there are no available squares for the Sovereign to move to, akin to checkmate in chess, the game concludes as a draw because neither player completed the objective.  If an opponent's Consultant is one move away from obstructing the path of your Sovereign, the Sovereign cannot move through it––this includes traveling through connected towers, unless the Consultant could not make the move (ie, the tower in question is three levels tall and the Consultant is on the ground level).  When the Sovereign reaches a third level tower in the opponents back two ranks the game is over, and the player who achieved the objective wins.

The Diplomat moves the same as the Sovereign and plays a crucial role in defending your pieces.  When the Diplomat occupies a tower at level two or higher, your pieces in the eight adjacent squares are protected from being captured by an opponents Consultant, restricting their movement to occupied spaces, though towers are still reduced by one level in unoccupied spaces.  If the Diplomat descends to a level one tower, or lower, the protection is no longer active.  If the Sovereign is protected from an imminent attack (opponents Consultant could remove Sovereign if Diplomat wasn't protecting it) then the Diplomat cannot move.

For test playing I have used chess pieces on a chessboard, before a friend made a 7x7 cork board for me.  Queen > Sovereign, Rook > Diplomat, Knight > Consultant, Pawn > Contractor.  The tower concept was fully realized with the help of pieces from Santorini and Torres, two fantastic tabletop games that I highly recommend you check out if tabletop games are your thing.
